We are creating a cutting edge VHS rental application management system for our special clients that value the old time retro VHS experience.

### VHS Rental Application

#### API
1. Implement a VHS resource RESTful API over http. 
Path to this resource should be: /api/vhs
3. Implement CRUD RESTful API for Rental resource. 
Path to this resource should be: /api/rental
#### JPA
- Model VHS as JPA Entity
- Model User as JPA Entity
- Model Rental as JPA Entity
#### Requirements
- RentalController should accept needed user ID data, vhs ID data, and rental date(use form or PATH parameters) 
- Make sure that the same vhs can't have multiple rentals on the same date
- handle rental due dates and late fees
- 4 HTTP methods should be implemented. (e.g. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE)
- Use Spring Data JPA Repositories
- Use Slf4j Logback logging 
- Implement @ExceptionHandler to catch and handle all exceptions
- Use Bean Validation on RentalForm to validate requests to RentalController
- Customize error messages from REST controller with Message Source
- Prepopulate database of choice (H2, Postgresql or any other non-Oracle database)
- Create an automated test for functionality of choice 


#### UI or Postman collection
Create a simple postman collection for our VHS rental shop that will have these mandatory actions (put it in your git repository root folder):
- VHS
  - List
  - VHS Rent and Return option
- List of Rentals
